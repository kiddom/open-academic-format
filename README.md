# Open Academic Format Spec

The current version of the Open Academic Format is 0.0 - you can find it [here](https://github.com/kiddom/open-academic-format/tree/master/versions/00/oaf-00.md)

This specification aims to provide a conceptual data model for academic content for K-12 education.
Our initial goal is to support Curriculum, and Assignment Content.

Alongside the specification, we'll be providing a set of open source libraries and tools to enable
usage in platforms other than Kiddom.

## Fastest way to get started

At this time, the fastest way to get started is to look at the current draft specification and
contribute. Once a working draft is reached, this paragraph will change. :)

## How to contribute

Contributions can take a variety of forms. We would suggest cloning this repository and submitting
pull requests if you're into the nitty gritty of it (or you see a typo!). If not, look at the list
of open issues and contribute to the conversations there, or open a new issue to start a new
ideation thread.
