# Open Academic Format v0.0 (DRAFT)

## Abstract

Open Academic Format defines conceptual and concrete data structures as well as hierarchy to
pragmatically describe Academic Content such as Curriculum and Materials for Assignments. It aims to
increase ease of interoperability and general usage of said content in varied educational software 
platforms.

## Status of Document

This document is a draft.

## Terminology and Conformance Language

Normative text describes one or both of the following kinds of elements:

* Vital elements of the specification
* Elements that contain the conformance language key words as defined by [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels"

Informative text is potentially helpful to the user, but dispensable. Informative text can be changed, added, or deleted editorially without negatively affecting the implementation of the specification. Informative text does not contain conformance keywords.

All text in this document is, by default, normative.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [IETF RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt) "Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels".
